## Inroduction

### What is Handwritten Digit Classification?
Handwritten digit Classification is the problem where machines recognize and classify human handwritten digits. The task is to take images of a digit as an input and classify the digit correctly in the image as an output.

### MNIST dataset
* MNIST is a collection of handwritten digits images ranging from the number 0 to 9. 
* MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images that are classified into corresponding labels from 0 to 9. So, MNIST dataset has 10 different classes.
* MNIST images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

### Neural Network for Classification 

In this article, we will look at the MNIST dataset and create a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. Later we will also add a hidden layer to make the model more accurate.

### Performance Evaluation of the Network
